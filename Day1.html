        What is SPA
    </h2>
    <p>
        A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application or website that dynamically rewrites the current web page with new data from the web server, 
        instead of the default method of the browser loading entire new pages
    </p>
    <h2>what is virtual DOM</h2>
    <p>The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM (Document Object Model).
         It is a tree-like structure that represents the HTML elements and their attributes of a web page. The VDOM is created in memory and is not directly rendered to the screen. Instead, it is used to compare the current state of the UI with the previous state. This allows React to determine which elements need to be updated, and only those elements are updated. This can significantly improve the performance of React applications, 
        as it avoids the need to constantly update the entire DOM.</p>
    <h2>
        What is difference between class and functional component
    </h2>
    <p>1.The main difference between class and functional components in React is that class components are stateful, while functional components are stateless. This means that class components can have their own state, which can be changed over time, while functional components cannot.
       2. Another difference between class and functional components is that class components can use lifecycle methods, while functional components cannot. Lifecycle methods are functions that are called at different stages of a component's lifecycle, such as when it is mounted, updated, or unmounted. Functional components can use hooks to achieve similar functionality, but hooks are not as flexible as lifecycle methods.

    <h2>
        What is package.json
    </h2>
    <p>ackage.json is a file in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format that contains information about a project's dependencies, scripts, and other configurations. It is a core element of the React ecosystem and is used by the 
        Node Package Manager (NPM) to install dependencies and run scripts.</p>
    <h2>What does mean by state and its use in react?</h2>
    <p>
        Stateful components are components that have internal state. 
        This means that they can store data and change their behaviour based on that data. Stateless components, on the other hand, do not have internal state. This means that they can only render what is given to them.
Stateful components are typically used for components that need to interact with the user or that need to change their behaviour based on data. Stateless components are typically used for components that only need to render data.

    <h2>
        What is JSX and why do we use it instead of js?
    </h2>
    <p>
        jSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension of JavaScript that allows us to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It is popularly used in React, as it makes the job of building an application much easier.
